# Some Thoughts

Being the first proper project we participate as a team, though many mishaps here and there, we see it now as opportunity, opportunity not only for us to know each and other team members but also a practice aims to enhance our skill in developing as an individual and perform as a group. Truely an unforgetable experience as a whole, not just the project alone but also the course as we get to know more about our desired field. Therefore this will be kept as a precious memory for us to carry throughout our career as software engineers. Thank you Mr. Dung, our lecturer for being such an incredible comfort and support, helping us getting through tough times. Sincerely, The 4-person team.

Some other thoughts from fellow team members:

- Khanh : To Mr. Dung, you are my captain, without you, I'm nothing but a sinking ship.
- Chau : From this project alone I have experienced the moment of having 7 bugs in 1 hour alone. What a memorable time to have.
- Thanh : I'm glad that from this project, I get a lot experiences, from things like headache, backache, soaring eyes, cold and fever here and there and an incredible routine of having 3 hours of sleep and 21 hours thinking about codes and deadlines.
- An : Through this assignment, I learned that just 1 dot, 1 "/" placed in the wrong place made me stay up until 2am, 1 a tag placed in the wrong place also caused a bug but the bug did not report an error. So I learned that reporting an error is fun but a bug that does not report an error is very tiring and a headache.
